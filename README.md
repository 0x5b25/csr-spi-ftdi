# CSR BlueCore SPI USB programmer

This is the driver for CSR BlueCore chips USB SPI programmer, based on FTDI USB
to Serial converter chip. It's written for use with CSR tools (such as BlueLab
or BlueSuite) under Windows or under Linux with [Wine](http://www.winehq.org/).
It works by replacing SPI LPT programmer driver, spilpt.dll, in CSR
applications.

Advantages:
* Works on Linux and Windows;
* Does not require LPT port;
* Cheap accessible hardware (search for "FT232RL module" on Ebay).

Disadvantages:
* Not very fast (70 seconds to read/write 1MB flash);
* See [BUGS](#bugs) section.

Programmer hardware can be made using simple FTDI adapter or breakout board.
Alternately You may build dedicated programmer using the included schematic.

## Hardware

### Supported FTDI chips

Driver is using FTDI syncronous bitbang mode for SPI, thus it should work with
any of the following FTDI chips:

* FT232R
* FT232H
* FT2232H/C/D
* FT4232H


### Using FTDI adapter as a programmer

You can build a simple programmer using popular FTDI breakout boards (search
Ebay for "FT232RL module 3.3" for example). Pinout specified in spi.c file.
Change it at will. Beware that FTDI boards usually provide 5V or 3V3 I/O levels
while CSR chips require 3V3 or 1V8 I/O level. You may supply appropriate VCCIO
to FTDI chip or use logic level converter if levels don't match. See
description of VCCIO pin in FTDI chip datasheet for details.

| Signal | FT232RL pin | FTDI pin name | FTDI GPIO pin | CSR pin  |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| CS#    | 2           | DTR#          | D4            | SPI_CS#  |
| CLK    | 3           | RTS#          | D2            | SPI_CLK  |
| MOSI   | 6           | RI#           | D7            | SPI_MOSI |
| MISO   | 9           | DSR#          | D5            | SPI_MISO |
| TX     | 1           | TXD           | Not used      | UART_RX  |
| RX     | 5           | RXD           | Not used      | UART_TX  |
| LED_RD | 10          | DCD#          | D6            | --       |
| LED_WR | 11          | CTS#          | D3            | --       |

TX and RX connections are optional and provide connectivity to BlueCore UART.

LED connections are optional. Wire LEDs cathodes through the current limiting
resistors (330 Ohm works fine) to the appropriate FTDI
pins. Wire LEDs anodes to FTDI 3V3 pin.


## Software

### CSR SPI API versions

This driver implements CSR SPI API version 1.3 and 1.4, different DLLs built
for each API version during a compile time. Example of CSR packages that use
API version 1.4:

* CSR BlueSuite 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.8

Example of CSR packages using API version 1.3:

* CSR BlueSuite 2.1, 2.3
* CSR BlueLab 4.1

You can check the API version of CSR package by inspecting original spilpt.dll
with the following command on Linux:

    winedump -j export spilpt.dll | grep spifns_stream_

If the output is not empty, then the original DLL implements newer version of
API (version 1.4).

New versions of BlueSuite can be found at https://www.csrsupport.com/PCSW.
Old versions of BlueSuite can be found at
https://www.csrsupport.com/PCSWArchive. Access to these pages requires
registration.


### Installing prebuilt drivers

Prebuilt drivers for Linux and Windows can be downloaded from https://github.com/lorf/csr-spi-ftdi/releases.

#### Installing on Ubuntu/Debian Linux

Install Wine:

    sudo apt-get install wine

Install CSR BlueSuite in Wine. Find all instances of spilpt.dll installed and
move them out of the way:

    find ~/.wine -iname spilpt.dll -execdir mv {} {}.orig \;

Copy approproate version of the .dll.so file to Wine system directory:

   sudo cp -p spilpt-<SPI_API_version>-wine/spilpt.dll.so /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/

where `<SPI_API_version>` is one of `1.3` or `1.4` (see [CSR SPI API
versions](#csr-spi-api-versions)). Alternately You can specify location of the
.dll.so file in WINEDLLPATH environment variable, see wine(1) man page for
details.

Run CSR apps.


#### Installing on Windows

1. Install CSR package such as BlueSuite;
2. Make a backup of spilpt.dll in your application directory (e.g. in
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\CSR\BlueSuite 2.5.8\`);
3. Copy appropriate version of spilpt.dll from spilpt-1.4-win32 or
   spilpt-1.3-win32 directory (see [CSR SPI API
   versions](#csr-spi-api-versions)) to your application directory;
4. Connect Your FTDI device to computer;
5. Download and run Zadig from http://zadig.akeo.ie/. In Options menu choose
   "List all devices", choose Your FTDI device ("FT232R USB UART" or similar),
   choose libusbK driver, press "Replace driver" or "Install driver".  This
   will install generic libusb-compatible driver for your FTDI chip. There is a
   nice [tutorial](http://embedded-funk.net/running-libftdi-under-windows/) on
   running libftdi programs on Windows;
6. Run your CSR apps.

### BUGS

* Driver sometimes fails with error "Unable to start read (invalid control
  data)". The problem is clearly in SPI communication, but I still can not
  figure out the cause. Anyway, restarting operation helps.
* BC57F687A chip stops talking SPI after first operation finishes, after that
  it needs a power cycle to resurrect.
* Driver for API 1.4 does not support more than one FTDI device connected to
  the computer at the same time. This is due to a limited stream API
  implementation.


## Thanks
